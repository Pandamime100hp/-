          This site was made to show case my brilliance in web development. 
          Over time, more and more functionality will be added which will 
          allow you to view all kinds of data about SpaceX. Speaking of 
          SpaceX, a little disclaimer. This site is not affiliated with the 
          company in any way.

          The source code for this site can be found <a 
          href="https://github.com/makar/go-rocket">here</a> <em><b>or</b></em> by 
          clicking on the little icon of the creature in the bottom right 
          hand corner of the site. To give some background to the website (and to 
          fill in some more white space on the homepage), the site was originally 
          built using Javascript, React and Vite. Now however, Optimus Prime would 
          be proud as I have TRANSFORMED the site! With thanks to Typescript, Next 
          JS and React, the site functions much more elegantly, efficiantly and 
          most of all works.
